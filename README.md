# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Wireshark Installation
- Wireshark was downloaded from the official website: [https://www.wireshark.org/](https://www.wireshark.org/)
- Successfully installed on the system.

### 2. Interface Selection
- Selected the active network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi) for live packet capture.

### 3. Traffic Generation
To create diverse network traffic, the following actions were performed during the capture:
- Visited several websites via a browser.
- Used the ping command to reach google.com.
- Checked DNS resolution using the nslookup command.

### 4. Capture Duration
- Captured network traffic for approximately 1 minute to keep the data manageable.

### 5. Protocol Filtering
Used Wireshark's filter bar to isolate specific protocols:
- http – Web traffic
- dns – Domain name lookups
- tcp – General TCP traffic

### 6. Exporting Capture
- Exported the full packet capture as a .pcap file for further analysis and submission.
